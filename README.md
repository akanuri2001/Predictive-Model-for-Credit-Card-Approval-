In our project, titled "Predictive Model for Credit Card Approval," we developed a system that leverages advanced technologies to predict the outcomes of credit card applications before they're formally submitted. Our aim was to minimize the negative impact of hard inquiries on applicants' credit scores and to enhance the efficiency of the application process for financial institutions.

We used a rich dataset from Kaggle to build a model that provides real-time assessments of credit card approvals. This not only helps applicants by preventing unnecessary hits to their credit scores but also allows financial institutions to concentrate their resources on applications with a high likelihood of approval, thereby improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Here's a breakdown of the tools and technologies we employed:

Python was our primary language for data analysis, model building, and deployment, supported by libraries suitable for these tasks.
We used PySpark for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering on a large scale.
TensorFlow and MLlib were chosen for developing the machine learning models due to their robustness and capability to handle complex predictive models.
The models were deployed using Kubernetes Engine, ensuring they were scalable and could be managed efficiently in a production environment.
For data visualization and reporting, we opted for either Tableau or Power BI, which allowed us to create insightful and interactive data visualizations.
Azure Data Factory, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Synapse were instrumental in our data processing and storage strategy, providing powerful cloud-based solutions for handling and analyzing large datasets.
Our approach included extensive data manipulation, such as merging, transformation, and feature engineering, to prepare the dataset for effective model training. The data processing was performed using Apache Spark, and the results were visualized using Power BI to ensure our findings were communicated clearly.

This predictive model has the potential to significantly improve the credit card application process, benefiting both applicants and financial institutions by forecasting approval probabilities and allowing for more streamlined and efficient processes.
